<!-- This is a placeholder for the PREC logo -->
<!-- You should replace this with the actual PREC college logo image -->
<!-- The logo should be named 'prec-logo.png' and placed in the same directory as index.html -->

<!-- For now, you can use any engineering college logo or create one with the following specifications:
- Size: 200x200 pixels minimum
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Content: Should include "PREC" text and engineering symbols
- Colors: Should match the website theme (blues, purples, accent colors)
-->

<!-- To add the actual logo:
1. Save the PREC logo image as 'prec-logo.png'
2. Place it in the same folder as index.html
3. The logo will automatically appear in the navigation bar
